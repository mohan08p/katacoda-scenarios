All these Stellar Cores—the network of nodes—eventually agree on sets of transactions. Each transaction on the network costs a small fee: 100 stroops (0.00001 XLM). This fee helps prevent bad actors from spamming the network. The Stellar network refers to the technology that processes financial transactions. The technology is open source, distributed, and community owned. [Stellar.org](https://www.stellar.org/) is the nonprofit organization that contributes to the development of tools and social good initiatives around the Stellar network and financial inclusion. Employees contribute code to the Stellar network, but the technology is independent of the organization. Though transactions require an Internet connection at the moment, tools for low-bandwidth environments are in development.
